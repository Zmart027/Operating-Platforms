# Operating-Platforms
#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. 

#Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room. They had an already established game Draw It or Lose It that was currently available to android users. They wanted us to expand this game so that is could be functional for users acroos many platforms or operating systems. Each game and team name needed to be unique. The game neded to bed developed to only allow one instance of the game to exist in memory at a time. Each team could have more than one player assigned per team. It also  needed the ability to have multiple or single teams playing per game.

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Honestly, I felt like I could have done better in this course but I felt like was able to communicate well. The only thing I know I needed to improve on in this aspect is break it down and explain further. 

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The template itself was a huge help. It helped avoid repetition and allowed for a through analysis and process of the overall project. It broke it down in sections which also made this easier to follow and allowed me to view bits and pieces of code at a time rather than a whole. 

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of the work on these documents to revise it would be Memory and Storage sections. I would express and explain further so the client can better understand and I would probably add some type of visual which would probably help the client and myself in explaining and understanding. 

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to to consider the user needs when designing as this can lead to improved product success. We need to be able to interpret client needs to the development successfully which allows the development team to discuss any risk or issues with said need. That way we can communicate it back to client and come up with a solution that both parties can agree to and work with. This saves time and money on both ends and lets clients decide if they want to move foward with the project or look elsewhere. 

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In this project I ensure to read the provided material and reseach things that were a bit more difficult to understand. In the future to analyze and design a smilar software application, I would like the template break things up in sections to help me better grasp and understand the bigger picture. I would also ensure to take the time to further explain and ensure I am not constantly repeating myself.
